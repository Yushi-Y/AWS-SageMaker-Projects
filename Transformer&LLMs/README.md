# Deploy and fine-tune pre-trained LLMs on SageMaker Jumpstart
- Transformers_SageMaker.ipynb: Did tokenization and positional encoding, self-attention, and used GPT-2 in Sagemaker notebooks with Huggingface
- text-generation-falcon.ipynb: Deployed the Falcon models in Sagemaker to do a variety of text generation tasks (summarisation, QA, etc.)
- llama-2-finetuning.ipynb: Learned to fine-tune LLama-2 models for instruction text data in Sagemaker
