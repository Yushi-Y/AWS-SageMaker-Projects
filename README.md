# AWS-SageMaker-Projects
In these SageMaker Notebooks, I explored built-in and custom machine learning models on SageMaker for e.g. object detection, image classification, article retrieval, and natural language generation. Furthermore, I explored some Jupiter notebooks running on EC2 instances, or EMR clusters with Spark.

The notebooks are modified based on the official AWS ML Learning Plan, Udemy's AWS ML Speciality course, and other online sources.
