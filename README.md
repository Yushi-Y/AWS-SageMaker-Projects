# AWS-SageMaker-Projects
In these SageMaker Notebooks, I explored built-in and custom machine learning models on SageMaker for e.g. object detection, price classification, and natural language generation. Furthermore, I explored some Jupiter notebooks running on EC2 instances (with EMR clusters or/and Spark) for image classification and article retrieval. 

The notebooks are modified based on the official AWS ML Learning Plan, Udemy's AWS ML Speciality course, and other online sources.
