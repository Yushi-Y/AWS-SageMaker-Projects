# Deploy and fine-tune pre-trained LLMs on SageMaker Jumpstart
- Transformers_SageMaker.ipynb: Added tokenization and positional encoding, self-attention, and used GPT-2 in Sagemaker notebooks with Huggingface

- text-generation-falcon.ipynb: Deployed Falcon models in Sagemaker to do a variety of text generation tasks (summarisation, question answering, etc.)

- llama-2-finetuning.ipynb: Used Sagemaker to fine-tune LLama-2 model for instruction-like text data
