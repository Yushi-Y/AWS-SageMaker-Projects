# Deploy and fine-tune pre-trained LLMs on SageMaker Jumpstart
- Transformers_SageMaker.ipynb: Included tokenization and positional encoding, self-attention, and deployed GPT-2 in Sagemaker notebooks with Huggingface

- text-generation-falcon.ipynb: Deployed the pre-trained Falcon models in Sagemaker to do a variety of text generation tasks (summarisation, question answering, etc.)

- llama-2-finetuning.ipynb: Fine-tuned the pre-trained LLama-2 model for instruction-like text data in Sagemaker
