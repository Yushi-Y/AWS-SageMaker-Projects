# AWS-SageMaker-Projects
These AWS SageMaker Notebooks provide built-in and custom ML models for e.g. object detection and image classification, from the official AWS ML Learning Plan, the Udemy course on AWS ML Speciality, and other online resources. Also explored some Jupiter notebooks running on EC2 instances.
